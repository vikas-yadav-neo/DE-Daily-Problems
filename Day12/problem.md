## **Problem Scenario: Online Learning Engagement Analysis**

### **Background**

You are working for an online learning platform (like Coursera or Udemy).
The platform tracks student activities such as **logins, watching videos, attempting quizzes, completing courses, and forum participation** across multiple courses and devices.

However, the raw data contains:

* Missing device/location information
* Multiple activity types per student per day
* Varying engagement durations for different activities

The company wants **daily engagement analytics** and **course-level insights** for product and academic teams.

---

## **Business Objectives**

1. **Daily Engagement Metrics**

   * Total active students per day
   * Total activities per day
   * Average session duration per day
   * Device and location distribution

2. **Course-Level Analytics**

   * Course completion rates
   * Top 5 courses by engagement time
   * Unique students per course per day

3. **Student Behavior Metrics**

   * Average time spent per student per day
   * Number of quizzes attempted per student
   * Students completing at least 1 course per week

## **Expected Output 2 – Course-Level Analytics**

| date       | course\_id | completion\_rate(%) | total\_time\_spent | unique\_students |
| ---------- | ---------- | ------------------- | ------------------ | ---------------- |
| 2025-08-20 | C2         | 35%                 | 1200 mins          | 45               |

## **Expected Output 3 – Student Behavior Metrics**

| student\_id | date       | total\_time\_spent | quizzes\_attempted | courses\_completed |
| ----------- | ---------- | ------------------ | ------------------ | ------------------ |
| S1          | 2025-08-20 | 250 mins           | 2                  | 1                  |

This scenario mimics **real-world complexity** with:

* Missing values handling
* Per-day, per-course, and per-student aggregations
* Multiple dimensions like device, location, and activity types
